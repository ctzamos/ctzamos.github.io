I study Computer Science in the **[Theory of Computation](http://toc.csail.mit.edu/)** group at **[MIT](http://www.mit.edu/)** where I am advised by **[Constantinos Daskalakis](http://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/)**.

My research interests include Algorithmic Game Theory, Learning Theory as well as the Design, Analysis and Theory of Algorithms.

## About

I joined the graduate program of **[MIT](http://www.mit.edu/)** on September 2011 in the Theory of Computation group at CSAIL. My PhD advisor is Costis Daskalakis and I enjoy working with him on a wide range of problems from auction theory to learning theory.

I grew up in Athens, Greece where I also had my undergraduate studies at the **[National Technical University of Athens](http://www.ntua.gr)** (Sept. 2006 - June 2011). During my time there, I had the opportunity to work with my advisor Dimitris Fotakis on different problems in mechanism design without money.

I spent the summer of 2014 as a research intern at **[Yahoo! Labs](http://yahoo.com)**, Sunnyvale working with Chris Wilkens on multiple research and practical questions regarding online ad auctions. I also interned for **[Google](http://google.com)**, Cambridge in the mobile search team during summer 2012.

## Research

I am interested in Algorithmic Game Theory, Learning Theory as well as in the Design, Analysis and Theory of Algorithms.
