## About

I am a post-doctoral researcher at **[Microsoft Research New England](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/chtzamos/)** working on Mechanism Design, Algorithms and Machine Learning.

On August 2018, I will join the **[Theory of Computing group](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/areas/theory/)** at UW Madison as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science. 

I completed my PhD in the Theory of Computation group at **[MIT](http://www.mit.edu/)** under the supervision of Costis Daskalakis. I grew up in Athens, Greece where I also had my undergraduate studies at the **[National Technical University of Athens](http://www.ntua.gr)**.

## Research

I am interested in Algorithmic Game Theory, Learning Theory as well as in the Design, Analysis and Theory of Algorithms.
